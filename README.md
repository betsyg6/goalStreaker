# Goal Streaker :trophy:

Inspired by New Years Resolutions that never seem to stick, Goal Streaker is an app that lets users track their progress/streak towards a goal they've committed to for a certain amount of days. It takes 14 days to form a habit, so the challenge is: Can you spend the next 14 days committed to a goal, that could ideally form into a daily practice or habit and improve your lifestyle? Developed using React, Firebase (for user authentication and as a real time database), Chart.js for data visualization, and Material-UI for stlying by Betsy Groton.
